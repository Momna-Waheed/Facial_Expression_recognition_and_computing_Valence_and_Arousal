# Facial_Expression_recognition_and_computing_Valence_and_Arousal
 The goal of this assignment is to develop an accurate and effi-
cient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for recog-
nizing facial expressions and computing valence and arousal for the
given dataset. The dataset consists of facial images and their cor-
responding labels for six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger,
surprise, fear, and disgust), valence (degree of positivity or negativ-
ity of an emotion) and arousal (degree of intensity of an emotion).
To achieve this goal, two CNN baseline architectures ResNet18 and Effe-
icientNet have been modified and implemented. The models are trained
and evaluated on the provided dataset for certain performance measures
